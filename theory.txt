--------------------------BRANCHING------------------------------------------
Branching in Git allows you to diverge from the main development line (usually called the master branch) and continue working on a separate line of development. This is useful for working on new features,
bug fixes, or experimental changes without affecting the main codebase until the changes are ready to be merged.


Eg:: Suppose in a project various developers are working assigned various functionalities in the software

Master Branch         
c1(commit)->c2(commit)->c3(commit)-----------------------------> Merge
                            |                                   ^
                            |                                   |
      feature Branch      C1(Commit) ->C2(commit)-------------  |        All the changes made in the feature branch is not known by the master branch


Merge Conflict:---In feature branch merge is only possible if it does not conflict with the master branch
Suppose While working in the feature branch there is a bug that happened so we create a new branch named  hotflix branch resolved that issues and then merge that with the master branch
