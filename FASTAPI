FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints 

Key Features:

Performance:
FastAPI is designed to be one of the fastest web frameworks available. It achieves this by leveraging asynchronous programming and standard Python type hints.

Ease of Use:
It provides automatic interactive API documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc) generated from the API's endpoints and data models.

Data Validation and Serialization:
FastAPI uses Pydantic for data validation and serialization. This ensures that the data you receive is in the expected format and type, reducing bugs and errors.

Dependency Injection:
FastAPI provides a powerful dependency injection system that allows you to manage dependencies in a clean and efficient way.

Asynchronous Capabilities:
FastAPI supports asynchronous request handling, which can lead to significant performance improvements for I/O-bound operations.
