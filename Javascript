1. call Method
The call method allows you to invoke a function and specify the this value and any arguments you want to pass to the function.

Syntax:
functionName.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...);
thisArg refers to the object you want this to refer to in the function.
arg1, arg2, ... are the arguments you pass to the function.
Example:


let person = { firstname: "Akshay", lastname: "Saini" };

function greet(hometown, state) {
    console.log(this.firstname + " " + this.lastname + " from " + hometown + ", " + state);
}

greet.call(person, "Dehradun", "Uttarakhand");
// Output: Akshay Saini from Dehradun, Uttarakhand
Here, call allows greet to use person as its this context. This enables us to borrow the greet function for different objects.

2. apply Method
The apply method is similar to call, but it takes the arguments as an array instead of individual values.

Syntax:

functionName.apply(thisArg, [arg1, arg2, ...]);
thisArg is the object to use as this.
[arg1, arg2, ...] is an array of arguments passed to the function.
Example:


let person2 = { firstname: "Sachin", lastname: "Tendulkar" };

greet.apply(person2, ["Mumbai", "Maharashtra"]);
// Output: Sachin Tendulkar from Mumbai, Maharashtra
In this example, apply allows us to pass arguments as an array, which can be convenient when the arguments are already in an array format.

3. bind Method
The bind method doesnâ€™t immediately invoke the function. Instead, it creates a new function with the specified this value and arguments. You can then call this new function at a later time.

Syntax:

let newFunction = functionName.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...);
thisArg is the value of this inside the new function.
arg1, arg2, ... are optional arguments that will be preset in the new function.
Example:

let boundGreet = greet.bind(person2, "Mumbai", "Maharashtra");
boundGreet(); 
// Output: Sachin Tendulkar from Mumbai, Maharashtra
