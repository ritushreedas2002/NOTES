MongoDB is a NoSQL database developed by MongoDB Inc. It is designed for scalability, high performance, and ease of development. Unlike traditional relational databases (SQL), MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which can vary in structure.

MongoDB over SQL:
--------------------
1.Schema Flexibility: Built with horizontal scalability in mind. It supports sharding, which allows the database to be distributed across multiple servers, making it easier to scale out as the application grows.
2.Data Model: Stores data in BSON (binary JSON) format, allowing for the embedding of related data within a single document. This can lead to more natural and efficient data retrieval.
3.Performance: Optimized for read and write operations, particularly for large volumes of unstructured data. It can efficiently handle a high volume of concurrent read and write requests.


Documents-The basic unit of data in MongoDB.Analogous to a row in a SQL database.Stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format.
Collection-A group of MongoDB documents.Analogous to a table in a SQL database.
Database- A container for collections.Analogous to a database in a SQL system.Each database has its own set of files on the file system.


Optional Validation Schema
-----------------------------
In MongoDB, you can enforce optional validation schemas using the built-in schema validation feature. This allows you to define rules for the structure of documents in a collection. Validation can be applied to new documents and updates, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
Setting Up a Validation Schema
To set up a validation schema, you use the '$jsonSchema' operator within the validator option when creating a collection or modifying an existing one.
