MongoDB is a NoSQL database developed by MongoDB Inc. It is designed for scalability, high performance, and ease of development. Unlike traditional relational databases (SQL), MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which can vary in structure.

MongoDB over SQL:
1.Schema Flexibility: Built with horizontal scalability in mind. It supports sharding, which allows the database to be distributed across multiple servers, making it easier to scale out as the application grows.
2.Data Model: Stores data in BSON (binary JSON) format, allowing for the embedding of related data within a single document. This can lead to more natural and efficient data retrieval.
3.Performance: Optimized for read and write operations, particularly for large volumes of unstructured data. It can efficiently handle a high volume of concurrent read and write requests.
