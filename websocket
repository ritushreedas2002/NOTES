Websocket provide the web browser to communicate with the web server and the client continously without the need to close the connection after each exchange. This makes a real-time communication.

HTTP -a web development communication protocol.It is a stateless protocol that does not save the state of the client.
HTTP---->REST APIS(Representational State Transfer)---->POST,GET,PUT,DELETE
CLIENT-------------------(POST)--------->SERVER
<----------------------(SUCESS with code 200)----SERVER   and then the connection is closed.


WEBSOCKET
client-----------------(handshake request)-------------->Server
<----------------------------(Sucess)------------Server   as the connection is established the connection is ON forever untill you close the connection. So the client can post the data, delete data and server can get the data.

HTTP Long Polling- The connection wil fallback to HTTP long-polling in case the socket connection cannot be established
